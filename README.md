# spreadsheetorganisation
I was recently assigned the task of performing a data clense on a large database in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. This spreadsheet also included a large amount of broken hyperlinks. Given the scale of this job and the fact that the overall database required reorganising, rather than attempting to solve this manually, I wrote a Python script instead. The script itself is currently a WIP.

Tech stack:
- Python
- OpenPyXl
